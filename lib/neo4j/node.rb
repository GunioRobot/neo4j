  # A node in the graph with properties and relationships to other entities.
  # Along with relationships, nodes are the core building blocks of the Neo4j data representation model.
  # Node has three major groups of operations: operations that deal with relationships, operations that deal with properties and operations that traverse the node space.
  # The property operations give access to the key-value property pairs.
  # Property keys are always strings. Valid property value types are the primitives(<tt>String</tt>, <tt>Fixnum</tt>, <tt>Float</tt>, <tt>Boolean</tt>), and arrays of those primitives.
  #
  # === Instance Methods form Included Mixins
  # * Neo4j::Property - methods that deal with properties
  # * Neo4j::NodeRelationship methods for relationship
  # * Neo4j::Equal equality operators: <tt>eql?</tt>, <tt>equal</tt>, <tt>==</tt>
  # * Neo4j::Index lucene index methods, like indexing a node
  #
  # === Class Methods from Included Mixins
  # * Neo4j::Index::ClassMethods lucene index class methods, like find
  # * Neo4j::Load - methods for loading a node
  #
  # See also the Neo4j::NodeMixin (Neo4j::Mapping::NodeMixin) if you want to wrap a node with your own Ruby class.

    ##
    # :method: del
    # Delete the node and all its relationship.
    #
    # It might raise an exception if this method was called without a Transaction,
    # or if it failed to delete the node (it maybe was already deleted).
    #
    # If this method raise an exception you may also get an exception when the transaction finish.
    # This method is  defined in the  org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.NodeProxy which is return by Neo4j::Node.new
    #
    # ==== Returns
    # nil or raise an exception
    #

    ##
    # :method: exist?
    # returns true if the node exists in the database
    # This method is  defined in the  org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.NodeProxy which is return by Neo4j::Node.new

    ##
    # :method: wrapped_entity
    # same as _java_node
    # Used so that we have same method for both relationship and nodes
    # This method is  defined in the  org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.NodeProxy which is return by Neo4j::Node.new

    ##
    # :method: wrapper
    # Loads the Ruby wrapper for this node (unless it is already the wrapper).
    # If there is no _classname property for this node then it will simply return itself.
    # Same as Neo4j::Node.wrapper(node)
    # This method is  defined in the  org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.NodeProxy which is return by Neo4j::Node.new


    ##
    # :method: _java_node
    # Returns the java node/relationship object representing this object unless it is already the java object.
    # This method is  defined in the  org.neo4j.kernel.impl.core.NodeProxy which is return by Neo4j::Node.new

    class << self

      # Returns a new neo4j Node.
      # The return node is actually an Java obejct of type org.neo4j.graphdb.Node java object
      # which has been extended (see the included mixins for Neo4j::Node).
      #
      # The created node will have a unique id - Neo4j::Property#neo_id
      #
      # ==== Parameters
      # *args :: a hash of properties to initialize the node with or nil
      #
      # ==== Returns
      # org.neo4j.graphdb.Node java object
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #  Neo4j::Transaction.run do
      #    Neo4j::Node.new
      #    Neo4j::Node.new :name => 'foo', :age => 100
